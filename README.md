# Hide Box MOdel
## What is this?

This is a small extention to hide Box Model viewer in Chrome DevTools.

## Why?

Most of the time when I use DevTools to inspect a web page, I hardly use the box model viewer, but it takes up a good amount of space and pushes down the Computed Styles down. That is why I wanted to hide the box model viewer.
